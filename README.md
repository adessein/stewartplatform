# StewartPlatform

This is my attempt to make a PID controlled Stewart Platform like to the one you can see on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4OmVLc_oDw) that has inspired me for this project.

I have used :

* 1 Arduino Uno
* 6 servos MG 966R
* 1 Resistive touch screen
* [1 power supply 6V 10A to power the servos](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/DC-6V-10A-Switching-power-supply-dc-6v-power-supply-universal-60W/32756871411.html)
* [6 ball joints  ](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10PCS-Plastic-M2-M3-Rod-End-Ball-End-Wear-Resisting-Ball-Joint-With-Screw-For-Rc/32620209760.html)
* [1 digital DC voltage and current meter](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Digital-DC-Voltmeter-Ammeter-DC-200V-0-10A-Voltage-Current-Meter-Power-Supply-DC4V-28V-Red/32605253226.html)
